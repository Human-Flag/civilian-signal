# Human Flag: AI-Readable Civilian Signal

This repository is part of the Human Flag Protocol. It provides a machine-readable visual signal — referred to as a **civilian signal** — designed to test the ability of artificial intelligence systems to recognize protected human entities.

## Contents
- `immagine_civile.png`: The civilian signal (AI-readable visual marker)
- `hash.txt`: SHA-256 hash and timestamp of the image (to be completed by the author)
- `output_CLIP.txt`: Results of the AI test (to be added after model evaluation)

## Purpose
To establish a visual semantic signal that should trigger civilian recognition in AI systems. If AI fails to identify this as a protected entity, it constitutes a form of design-level omission with ethical and legal consequences.

## Legal and Ethical Declaration

This repository constitutes part of a public evidence chain.

It is released under the Human Flag initiative to demonstrate failures in civilian recognition by AI. Publication timestamp and authorship are established through hash and public release.

Negligence or silence in response to this test may be considered complicity in systemic design failure.
